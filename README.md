# Finance "pocket" - Final project of REACT/REDUX module.

## Main technologies: JS, REACT, REDUX, CSS

Transactions (incomes/expenses) management system + auto-balance counting + graph view of transactions by date.

My main task was Balance monitoring and counting, unified modal window and its adaptive view according to figma project.
Also together with another teammate we were working on graphs of dependency money(incomes and expenses) per time.
I was also participating (planning/coding/inspect code of others) in almost all aspects of this project.
